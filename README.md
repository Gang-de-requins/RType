## ðŸš€ Description ðŸš€

### History of the game

R-Type is an emblematic series of video games of the shoot them up with horizontal scrolling, developed by Irem and begun in 1987 on terminal of arcade. It is probably inspired by the Konami Gradius series, whose first episode was released two years earlier.

### Goal of the project

This project aims to recreate the R-Type game with a multi-threaded server using Boost::asio for the network, udp protocol and graphical client. We using an engine of unity.
R-tpye is composed of two parts: the server and the client, both in C++.

### Librairies
- Graphical : Raylib.
- Network : asio


## ðŸ”® Installation ðŸ”®

### Clone the project
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:EpitechPromo2026/B-CPP-500-PAR-5-2-rtype-ethan.saux.git

### Launch the script

  #### Linux

  To get started, issue this command to root :
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

  Go to vcpkg directory and run this command :
  ```bash
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
  ```

  Go to the root of the project and run this command :
  ```bash
  ./scripts/build_project.sh
  ```

  #### Windows

  To get started, issue this command to root :
  ```powershell
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

  Go to vcpkg directory and run this command :
  ```powershell
  ./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
  ```

  Go to the root of the project and run this command :
  ```powershell
  ./scripts/build_project.bat
  ``` 


## Usage

After running the script you will have two executable: "./r-type_client" and "./r-type_server

### Linux

#### Server

  In the terminal launched:
  ```bash
  ./r-type_server [PORT]
  ```

#### Client
