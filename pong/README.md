# PONG (2nd game)

## The purpose of this game

This game has been created in order to show that our ECS can be used to create different games.

## How to play ?

Nothing more simple, for that you will need to follow theses few steps:

First, you will have to build the vcpkg to then build the game, take a look at the README at the root.

When this is done, you will have to come back in pong/ folder and do this simple command :

For linux :

  ```bash
./scripts/build_pong.sh
  ```

Then do this :

  ```bash
./pong
  ```

There you go ! Then you can refer a name for both players, don't forget to press enter, otherwise, your name will not be saved !
Then you can play the game, but becareful, each time you touch the ball, it goes faster !
The first player that gives a goal, wins !
