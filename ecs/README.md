## What is an ecs ?

An Entity Component System is a design pattern that allows you to create entities and components that can be used in a game engine. <br>
The main idea is to create entities that are just a number, and components that are just data. <br>
The entities are stored in a vector for each scene, and the components are stored in a vector for each entity. <br>
